# Brick Breaker Game

For my project I created a simple brick breaker game, in which a ball bounces off a paddle and hit bricks. If a brick is hit, it disappears. The ball can also bounce of the walls and the top of the game. The goal is to hit as many bricks as possible.


## How do you play?


Brick breaker is easy to play -use the left and right arrow key on your computer's keyboard to move the paddle on the screen.  

## Rules of the game:

Bounce the ball off the paddle and don't let it touch the bottom of the screen. If you miss the ball - it's game over.  
For every brick you hit, collect 10 points.
